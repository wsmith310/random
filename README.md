So I've technically been coding since high school(of and on mostly off) I am going to school for computer science. Want to learn and meet people. The languages I have worked with are Java(in highschool), Python(when I started to study game dev at one college), and now learning c++ for comp sci at another college). I'm here basically to learn and meet like minded people and maybe collab and such.
